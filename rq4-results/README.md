# Data for Experiments for RQ4



# A list of claims from the paper not supported by the artifact, and how/why.

Our motivation for (RQ4) is producing reliable performance measurements by using benchexec which uses cgroups and other mechanisms to ensure that runtimes are reliable. Given the virtualization which occurs by using VirtualBox, the results of such a run would be no more representative than runs conducted with the setup we used for (RQ1-3). While the configurations for (RQ1-3) incur some overhead for marshaling, it is the same for all update rules.
Thus, the results from that run can stand in to inspire confidence in the numbers for (RQ4) but cannot directly reproduce them.
